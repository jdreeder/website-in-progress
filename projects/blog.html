            Currently I am building this blogging page via Colt Steel's Web Developer Bootcamp on Udemy. I'm ~30% into the course so far and I'm enjoying it quite well. We've gone through the basics of HTML and CSS, creating basic webpages with different elements and styles accordingly. This blog page is part of the intermediate CSS section, right before getting into Bootstrap.

            I'm really excited for the backend development portion of this class, as graphic design is not really my forte. With the knowledge I hope to gain from the rest of the course, I'm going to attempt to build a decentralized insurance company / platform, or maybe the next great messaging app of the 21st century.

        <h2>Blog Post 2: Electric Boogaloo!</h2>

            This is just a filler post to match the formatting of the tutorial. It required a second blog post that is inside the main body of the page.

            I could have just gone and grabbed some <i>Lorem Ipsum</i> text online, like from <a href="http://www.baconipsum.com">baconipsum.com</a>, but I felt like actually typing in some junk. Now it's time to style the little bar that appears in between the blog posts with something from an online source. Looks like there's a ton of options to choose from.
