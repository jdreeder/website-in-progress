                    On the way to work this morning, I saw at first glance what appeared to be someone in an oversized Parka slowly making their way across the street towards a Jack in the Box. But it was not a Parka...

                <p>
                    ...in fact it was a sleeping bag. Granted, it's 25 degrees outside but it caught me quite off guard to see a full zipped up sleeping bag on this human crossing the street. Then returning to the office after grabbing some lunch I spotted a man in a dark trench coat jay walking across the service road at Loop 12 and Irving Blvd. Pedestrians usually aren't notable enough to catch my eye, but today there happened to be two occurrences. Other than that, just a normal boring Friday. <br><br>
                  
                    Also there's some kind of small bird where I park my car in the evenings and it repeatedly shits on my mirrors unless they're covered. Aggravating little twats.

                      So I spent the last two hours trying to get this blog page to display with the same header, footer, and overall style as the main page...
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                      I have everything working correctly in my local environment by taking the main page folder heirarchy and mirroring it in this lower folder. However, when that gets uploaded to the S3 bucket it doesn't seem to translate properly. It seems there's trouble referencing anything in an upper folder due to the way that S3 buckets are not actualy heirarchies. I've seen it referenced as a key value pair, but I can't for the life of me figure out the proper way to reference my stylesheets.. Oh well, guess I'll give it another shot later. 
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    UPDATE (11:37pm): as it turns out, my theory about the folders was correct. my cache just did not refresh properly. everything is good to go (at least for now).

                      This is just a filler post to match the formatting of the tutorial. It required a second blog post that is inside the main body of the page.

                      I could have just gone and grabbed some <i>Lorem Ipsum</i> text online, like from <a href="http://www.baconipsum.com">baconipsum.com</a>, but I felt like actually typing in some junk. Now it's time to style the little bar that appears in between the blog posts with something from an online source. Looks like there's a ton of options to choose from.

                      Currently I am building this blogging page via Colt Steel's Web Developer Bootcamp on Udemy. I'm ~30% into the course so far and I'm enjoying it quite well. We've gone through the basics of HTML and CSS, creating basic webpages with different elements and styles accordingly. This blog page is part of the intermediate CSS section, right before getting into Bootstrap. 
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                      I'm really excited for the backend development portion of this class, as graphic design is not really my forte. With the knowledge I hope to gain from the rest of the course, I'm going to attempt to build a decentralized insurance company / platform, or maybe the next great messaging app of the 21st century.
